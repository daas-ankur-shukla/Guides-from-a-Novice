# Setting Up A Two Machine Spark Cluster

Lately I was required to setup a spark cluster for a project. Honestly speaking I was totally ignorant about the process and also about other concepts related to the process.

But having gone through the process now by two different methods, I have successfully setup a two machine cluster by both of them.

The issues I faced during the process occurred due to the following:

* Lack of knowledge about ssh concepts
* Lack of knowledge about the relevance of root access on Linux
* Various tutorials available with a simple Google search tend to assume the user to be acquainted with these concepts. Thus they don't mention them in the tutorial leading to problems for naive users
*
